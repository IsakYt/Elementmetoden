Here are the various functions we utilized in this project.
Task2 and Task3 will provide the plots and tests related to solving
the PDE problems. Some of the plots are no longer exactly as in the
pdf, as to save you some runtime.
Feel free to test the quadratures as you wish in Quadrature.py

Best regards,
Isak, Bj√∏rnar and Gjermund.
