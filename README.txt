Here are the various functions we utilized in this project.
Task2 and Task3 will provide the plots and tests related to solving
the PDE problems. Some of the plots are no longer exactly as in the
pdf, as to save you some runtime.

Task2.py will solve the poisson problem \laplace^2 u = -f with homogenous dirichelt conditions, using linear basis functions over triangular basis elements, on the unit disk.
Task3.py solves the same problem, but with neumann condtions on the boundary where y>0.

Feel free to test the quadratures as you wish in Quadrature.py
